# Clarifications

  1. TLS Certificate Management:
    - Should use cert-manager for automatic certificate provisioning
  2. Configuration Approach: use a yaml approach (only use the json tags in go structs, the k8s yaml package reads from the json tags)
  3. Deployment Scope:
    - I want Helm chart templates for the webhook (ValidatingWebhookConfiguration, MutatingWebhookConfiguration) in charts/shaper-webhooks
    - These must be created in a new chart named shaper-webhooks
  4. Integration Testing:
    - THe plan should include integration tests that deploy the webhook to the kindEnv cluster
  5. Webhook Registration:
    - both Assignment and Profile Should  use the same webhook server instance
    - use logical webhook paths (e.g., /validate-assignment, /mutate-profile)
  6. Health Checks:
    - we should include liveness/readiness probes like shaper-api
    - we should include a metrics endpoint

# IMPORTANT: kubebuilder webhook: deploying cert-manager

Deploying cert-manager
We suggest using cert-manager for provisioning the certificates for the webhook server. Other solutions should also work as long as they put the certificates in the desired location.

You can follow the cert-manager documentation to install it.

cert-manager also has a component called CA Injector, which is responsible for injecting the CA bundle into the MutatingWebhookConfiguration / ValidatingWebhookConfiguration.

To accomplish that, you need to use an annotation with key cert-manager.io/inject-ca-from in the MutatingWebhookConfiguration / ValidatingWebhookConfiguration objects. The value of the annotation should point to an existing certificate request instance in the format of <certificate-namespace>/<certificate-name>.

# Kubebuilder example: How to implement webhooks

Implementing defaulting/validating webhooks
If you want to implement admission webhooks for your CRD, the only thing you need to do is to implement the CustomDefaulter and (or) the CustomValidator interface.

Kubebuilder takes care of the rest for you, such as

Creating the webhook server.
Ensuring the server has been added in the manager.
Creating handlers for your webhooks.
Registering each handler with a path in your server.

This will scaffold the webhook functions and register your webhook with the manager in your main.go for you.

# what are Webhooks

Webhook
Webhooks are requests for information sent in a blocking fashion. A web application implementing webhooks will send a HTTP request to other applications when a certain event happens.

In the kubernetes world, there are 3 kinds of webhooks: admission webhook, authorization webhook and CRD conversion webhook.

In controller-runtime libraries, we support admission webhooks and CRD conversion webhooks.

Kubernetes supports these dynamic admission webhooks as of version 1.9 (when the feature entered beta).

Kubernetes supports the conversion webhooks as of version 1.15 (when the feature entered beta).

# Kubebuilder Webhook marker configuration

Webhook
These markers describe how webhook configuration is generated. Use these to keep the description of your webhooks close to the code that implements them.

Show Detailed Argument Help
// +kubebuilder:webhook
specifies how a webhook should be served.
It specifies only the details that are intrinsic to the application serving it (e.g. the resources it can handle, or the path it serves on).

admissionReviewVersionsstring
is an ordered list of preferred `AdmissionReview`
versions the Webhook expects.

failurePolicystring
specifies what should happen if the API server cannot reach the webhook.
It may be either "ignore" (to skip the webhook and continue on) or "fail" (to reject the object in question).

groupsstring
specifies the API groups that this webhook receives requests for.
matchPolicystring
defines how the "rules" list is used to match incoming requests.
Allowed values are "Exact" (match only if it exactly matches the specified rule) or "Equivalent" (match a request if it modifies a resource listed in rules, even via another API group or version).

mutatingbool
marks this as a mutating webhook (it's validating only if false)
Mutating webhooks are allowed to change the object in their response, and are called before all validating webhooks. Mutating webhooks may choose to reject an object, similarly to a validating webhook.

namestring
indicates the name of this webhook configuration. Should be a domain with at least three segments separated by dots
pathstring
specifies that path that the API server should connect to this webhook on. Must be
prefixed with a '/validate-' or '/mutate-' depending on the type, and followed by $GROUP-$VERSION-$KIND where all values are lower-cased and the periods in the group are substituted for hyphens. For example, a validating webhook path for type batch.tutorial.kubebuilder.io/v1,Kind=CronJob would be /validate-batch-tutorial-kubebuilder-io-v1-cronjob

reinvocationPolicystring
allows mutating webhooks to request reinvocation after other mutations
To allow mutating admission plugins to observe changes made by other plugins, built-in mutating admission plugins are re-run if a mutating webhook modifies an object, and mutating webhooks can specify a reinvocationPolicy to control whether they are reinvoked as well.

resourcesstring
specifies the API resources that this webhook receives requests for.
serviceNamestring
indicates the name of the K8s Service the webhook uses.
serviceNamespacestring
indicates the namespace of the K8s Service the webhook uses.
servicePortint
indicates the port of the K8s Service the webhook uses
sideEffectsstring
specify whether calling the webhook will have side effects.
This has an impact on dry runs and kubectl diff: if the sideEffect is "Unknown" (the default) or "Some", then the API server will not call the webhook on a dry-run request and fails instead. If the value is "None", then the webhook has no side effects and the API server will call it on dry-run. If the value is "NoneOnDryRun", then the webhook is responsible for inspecting the "dryRun" property of the AdmissionReview sent in the request, and avoiding side effects if that value is "true."

timeoutSecondsint
allows configuring how long the API server should wait for a webhook to respond before treating the call as a failure.
If the timeout expires before the webhook responds, the webhook call will be ignored or the API call will be rejected based on the failure policy. The timeout value must be between 1 and 30 seconds. The timeout for an admission webhook defaults to 10 seconds.

urlstring
allows mutating webhooks configuration to specify an external URL when generating
the manifests, instead of using the internal service communication. Should be in format of <https://address:port/path> When this option is specified, the serviceConfig.Service is removed from webhook the manifest. The URL configuration should be between quotes. url cannot be specified when path is specified.

verbsstring
specifies the Kubernetes API verbs that this webhook receives requests for.
Only modification-like verbs may be specified. May be "create", "update", "delete", "connect", or "*" (for all).

versionsstring
specifies the API versions that this webhook receives requests for.
webhookVersionsstring
specifies the target API versions of the {Mutating,Validating}WebhookConfiguration objects
itself to generate. The only supported value is v1. Defaults to v1.

// +kubebuilder:webhookconfiguration
specifies how a webhook should be served.
It specifies only the details that are intrinsic to the application serving it (e.g. the resources it can handle, or the path it serves on).

mutatingbool
marks this as a mutating webhook (it's validating only if false)
Mutating webhooks are allowed to change the object in their response, and are called before all validating webhooks. Mutating webhooks may choose to reject an object, similarly to a validating webhook.

# Kubernetes Admission Webhook documentation

Dynamic Admission Control
In addition to compiled-in admission plugins, admission plugins can be developed as extensions and run as webhooks configured at runtime. This page describes how to build, configure, use, and monitor admission webhooks.

What are admission webhooks?
Admission webhooks are HTTP callbacks that receive admission requests and do something with them. You can define two types of admission webhooks, validating admission webhook and mutating admission webhook. Mutating admission webhooks are invoked first, and can modify objects sent to the API server to enforce custom defaults. After all object modifications are complete, and after the incoming object is validated by the API server, validating admission webhooks are invoked and can reject requests to enforce custom policies.

Note:
Admission webhooks that need to guarantee they see the final state of the object in order to enforce policy should use a validating admission webhook, since objects can be modified after being seen by mutating webhooks.
Experimenting with admission webhooks
Admission webhooks are essentially part of the cluster control-plane. You should write and deploy them with great caution. Please read the user guides for instructions if you intend to write/deploy production-grade admission webhooks. In the following, we describe how to quickly experiment with admission webhooks.

Prerequisites
Ensure that MutatingAdmissionWebhook and ValidatingAdmissionWebhook admission controllers are enabled. Here is a recommended set of admission controllers to enable in general.

Ensure that the admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1 API is enabled.

Write an admission webhook server
Please refer to the implementation of the admission webhook server that is validated in a Kubernetes e2e test. The webhook handles the AdmissionReview request sent by the API servers, and sends back its decision as an AdmissionReview object in the same version it received.

See the webhook request section for details on the data sent to webhooks.

See the webhook response section for the data expected from webhooks.

The example admission webhook server leaves the ClientAuth field empty, which defaults to NoClientCert. This means that the webhook server does not authenticate the identity of the clients, supposedly API servers. If you need mutual TLS or other ways to authenticate the clients, see how to authenticate API servers.

Deploy the admission webhook service
The webhook server in the e2e test is deployed in the Kubernetes cluster, via the deployment API. The test also creates a service as the front-end of the webhook server. See code.

You may also deploy your webhooks outside of the cluster. You will need to update your webhook configurations accordingly.

Configure admission webhooks on the fly
You can dynamically configure what resources are subject to what admission webhooks via ValidatingWebhookConfiguration or MutatingWebhookConfiguration.

The following is an example ValidatingWebhookConfiguration, a mutating webhook configuration is similar. See the webhook configuration section for details about each config field.

apiVersion: admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1
kind: ValidatingWebhookConfiguration
metadata:
  name: "pod-policy.example.com"
webhooks:

- name: "pod-policy.example.com"
  rules:
  - apiGroups:   [""]
    apiVersions: ["v1"]
    operations:  ["CREATE"]
    resources:   ["pods"]
    scope:       "Namespaced"
  clientConfig:
    service:
      namespace: "example-namespace"
      name: "example-service"
    caBundle: <CA_BUNDLE>
  admissionReviewVersions: ["v1"]
  sideEffects: None
  timeoutSeconds: 5
Note:
You must replace the <CA_BUNDLE> in the above example by a valid CA bundle which is a PEM-encoded (field value is Base64 encoded) CA bundle for validating the webhook's server certificate.
The scope field specifies if only cluster-scoped resources ("Cluster") or namespace-scoped resources ("Namespaced") will match this rule. "∗" means that there are no scope restrictions.

Note:
When using clientConfig.service, the server cert must be valid for <svc_name>.<svc_namespace>.svc.
Note:
Default timeout for a webhook call is 10 seconds, You can set the timeout and it is encouraged to use a short timeout for webhooks. If the webhook call times out, the request is handled according to the webhook's failure policy.
When an API server receives a request that matches one of the rules, the API server sends an admissionReview request to webhook as specified in the clientConfig.

After you create the webhook configuration, the system will take a few seconds to honor the new configuration.

Authenticate API servers
If your admission webhooks require authentication, you can configure the API servers to use basic auth, bearer token, or a cert to authenticate itself to the webhooks. There are three steps to complete the configuration.

When starting the API server, specify the location of the admission control configuration file via the --admission-control-config-file flag.

In the admission control configuration file, specify where the MutatingAdmissionWebhook controller and ValidatingAdmissionWebhook controller should read the credentials. The credentials are stored in kubeConfig files (yes, the same schema that's used by kubectl), so the field name is kubeConfigFile. Here is an example admission control configuration file:

apiserver.config.k8s.io/v1
apiserver.k8s.io/v1alpha1
apiVersion: apiserver.config.k8s.io/v1
kind: AdmissionConfiguration
plugins:

- name: ValidatingAdmissionWebhook
  configuration:
    apiVersion: apiserver.config.k8s.io/v1
    kind: WebhookAdmissionConfiguration
    kubeConfigFile: "<path-to-kubeconfig-file>"
- name: MutatingAdmissionWebhook
  configuration:
    apiVersion: apiserver.config.k8s.io/v1
    kind: WebhookAdmissionConfiguration
    kubeConfigFile: "<path-to-kubeconfig-file>"
For more information about AdmissionConfiguration, see the AdmissionConfiguration (v1) reference. See the webhook configuration section for details about each config field.

In the kubeConfig file, provide the credentials:

apiVersion: v1
kind: Config
users:

// name should be set to the DNS name of the service or the host (including port) of the URL the webhook is configured to speak to

// If a non-443 port is used for services, it must be included in the name when configuring 1.16+ API servers

// For a webhook configured to speak to a service on the default port (443), specify the DNS name of the service

// - name: webhook1.ns1.svc

// user

// For a webhook configured to speak to a service on non-default port (e.g. 8443), specify the DNS name and port of the service in 1.16+

// - name: webhook1.ns1.svc:8443

// user

// and optionally create a second stanza using only the DNS name of the service for compatibility with 1.15 API servers

// - name: webhook1.ns1.svc

// user

// For webhooks configured to speak to a URL, match the host (and port) specified in the webhook's URL. Examples

// A webhook with `url: https://www.example.com`

// - name: <www.example.com>

// user

// A webhook with `url: https://www.example.com:443`

// - name: <www.example.com:443>

// user

// A webhook with `url: https://www.example.com:8443`

// - name: <www.example.com:8443>

// user

- name: 'webhook1.ns1.svc'
  user:
    client-certificate-data: "<pem encoded certificate>"
    client-key-data: "<pem encoded key>"

# The `name` supports using * to wildcard-match prefixing segments

- name: '*.webhook-company.org'
  user:
    password: "<password>"
    username: "<name>"

# '*' is the default match

- name: '*'
  user:
    token: "<token>"
Of course you need to set up the webhook server to handle these authentication requests.

Webhook request and response
Request
Webhooks are sent as POST requests, with Content-Type: application/json, with an AdmissionReview API object in the admission.k8s.io API group serialized to JSON as the body.

Webhooks can specify what versions of AdmissionReview objects they accept with the admissionReviewVersions field in their configuration:

apiVersion: admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1
kind: ValidatingWebhookConfiguration
webhooks:

- name: my-webhook.example.com
  admissionReviewVersions: ["v1", "v1beta1"]
admissionReviewVersions is a required field when creating webhook configurations. Webhooks are required to support at least one AdmissionReview version understood by the current and previous API server.

API servers send the first AdmissionReview version in the admissionReviewVersions list they support. If none of the versions in the list are supported by the API server, the configuration will not be allowed to be created. If an API server encounters a webhook configuration that was previously created and does not support any of the AdmissionReview versions the API server knows how to send, attempts to call to the webhook will fail and be subject to the failure policy.

This example shows the data contained in an AdmissionReview object for a request to update the scale subresource of an apps/v1 Deployment:

{
  "apiVersion": "admission.k8s.io/v1",
  "kind": "AdmissionReview",
  "request": {
    # Random uid uniquely identifying this admission call
    "uid": "705ab4f5-6393-11e8-b7cc-42010a800002",

    # Fully-qualified group/version/kind of the incoming object
    "kind": {
      "group": "autoscaling",
      "version": "v1",
      "kind": "Scale"
    },

    # Fully-qualified group/version/kind of the resource being modified
    "resource": {
      "group": "apps",
      "version": "v1",
      "resource": "deployments"
    },

    # Subresource, if the request is to a subresource
    "subResource": "scale",

    # Fully-qualified group/version/kind of the incoming object in the original request to the API server
    # This only differs from `kind` if the webhook specified `matchPolicy: Equivalent` and the original
    # request to the API server was converted to a version the webhook registered for
    "requestKind": {
      "group": "autoscaling",
      "version": "v1",
      "kind": "Scale"
    },

    # Fully-qualified group/version/kind of the resource being modified in the original request to the API server
    # This only differs from `resource` if the webhook specified `matchPolicy: Equivalent` and the original
    # request to the API server was converted to a version the webhook registered for
    "requestResource": {
      "group": "apps",
      "version": "v1",
      "resource": "deployments"
    },

    # Subresource, if the request is to a subresource
    # This only differs from `subResource` if the webhook specified `matchPolicy: Equivalent` and the original
    # request to the API server was converted to a version the webhook registered for
    "requestSubResource": "scale",

    # Name of the resource being modified
    "name": "my-deployment",

    # Namespace of the resource being modified, if the resource is namespaced (or is a Namespace object)
    "namespace": "my-namespace",

    # operation can be CREATE, UPDATE, DELETE, or CONNECT
    "operation": "UPDATE",

    "userInfo": {
      # Username of the authenticated user making the request to the API server
      "username": "admin",

      # UID of the authenticated user making the request to the API server
      "uid": "014fbff9a07c",

      # Group memberships of the authenticated user making the request to the API server
      "groups": [
        "system:authenticated",
        "my-admin-group"
      ],

      # Arbitrary extra info associated with the user making the request to the API server
      # This is populated by the API server authentication layer
      "extra": {
        "some-key": [
          "some-value1",
          "some-value2"
        ]
      }
    },

    # object is the new object being admitted. It is null for DELETE operations
    "object": {
      "apiVersion": "autoscaling/v1",
      "kind": "Scale"
    },

    # oldObject is the existing object. It is null for CREATE and CONNECT operations
    "oldObject": {
      "apiVersion": "autoscaling/v1",
      "kind": "Scale"
    },

    # options contain the options for the operation being admitted, like meta.k8s.io/v1 CreateOptions,
    # UpdateOptions, or DeleteOptions. It is null for CONNECT operations
    "options": {
      "apiVersion": "meta.k8s.io/v1",
      "kind": "UpdateOptions"
    },

    # dryRun indicates the API request is running in dry run mode and will not be persisted
    # Webhooks with side effects should avoid actuating those side effects when dryRun is true
    "dryRun": false
  }
}
Response
Webhooks respond with a 200 HTTP status code, Content-Type: application/json, and a body containing an AdmissionReview object (in the same version they were sent), with the response stanza populated, serialized to JSON.

At a minimum, the response stanza must contain the following fields:

uid, copied from the request.uid sent to the webhook
allowed, either set to true or false
Example of a minimal response from a webhook to allow a request:

{
  "apiVersion": "admission.k8s.io/v1",
  "kind": "AdmissionReview",
  "response": {
    "uid": "<value from request.uid>",
    "allowed": true
  }
}
Example of a minimal response from a webhook to forbid a request:

{
  "apiVersion": "admission.k8s.io/v1",
  "kind": "AdmissionReview",
  "response": {
    "uid": "<value from request.uid>",
    "allowed": false
  }
}
When rejecting a request, the webhook can customize the http code and message returned to the user using the status field. The specified status object is returned to the user. See the API documentation for details about the status type. Example of a response to forbid a request, customizing the HTTP status code and message presented to the user:

{
  "apiVersion": "admission.k8s.io/v1",
  "kind": "AdmissionReview",
  "response": {
    "uid": "<value from request.uid>",
    "allowed": false,
    "status": {
      "code": 403,
      "message": "You cannot do this because it is Tuesday and your name starts with A"
    }
  }
}
When allowing a request, a mutating admission webhook may optionally modify the incoming object as well. This is done using the patch and patchType fields in the response. The only currently supported patchType is JSONPatch. See JSON patch documentation for more details. For patchType: JSONPatch, the patch field contains a base64-encoded array of JSON patch operations.

As an example, a single patch operation that would set spec.replicas would be [{"op": "add", "path": "/spec/replicas", "value": 3}]

Base64-encoded, this would be W3sib3AiOiAiYWRkIiwgInBhdGgiOiAiL3NwZWMvcmVwbGljYXMiLCAidmFsdWUiOiAzfV0=

So a webhook response to add that label would be:

{
  "apiVersion": "admission.k8s.io/v1",
  "kind": "AdmissionReview",
  "response": {
    "uid": "<value from request.uid>",
    "allowed": true,
    "patchType": "JSONPatch",
    "patch": "W3sib3AiOiAiYWRkIiwgInBhdGgiOiAiL3NwZWMvcmVwbGljYXMiLCAidmFsdWUiOiAzfV0="
  }
}
Admission webhooks can optionally return warning messages that are returned to the requesting client in HTTP Warning headers with a warning code of 299. Warnings can be sent with allowed or rejected admission responses.

If you're implementing a webhook that returns a warning:

Don't include a "Warning:" prefix in the message
Use warning messages to describe problems the client making the API request should correct or be aware of
Limit warnings to 120 characters if possible
Caution:
Individual warning messages over 256 characters may be truncated by the API server before being returned to clients. If more than 4096 characters of warning messages are added (from all sources), additional warning messages are ignored.
{
  "apiVersion": "admission.k8s.io/v1",
  "kind": "AdmissionReview",
  "response": {
    "uid": "<value from request.uid>",
    "allowed": true,
    "warnings": [
      "duplicate envvar entries specified with name MY_ENV",
      "memory request less than 4MB specified for container mycontainer, which will not start successfully"
    ]
  }
}
Webhook configuration
To register admission webhooks, create MutatingWebhookConfiguration or ValidatingWebhookConfiguration API objects. The name of a MutatingWebhookConfiguration or a ValidatingWebhookConfiguration object must be a valid DNS subdomain name.

Each configuration can contain one or more webhooks. If multiple webhooks are specified in a single configuration, each must be given a unique name. This is required in order to make resulting audit logs and metrics easier to match up to active configurations.

Each webhook defines the following things.

Matching requests: rules
Each webhook must specify a list of rules used to determine if a request to the API server should be sent to the webhook. Each rule specifies one or more operations, apiGroups, apiVersions, and resources, and a resource scope:

operations lists one or more operations to match. Can be "CREATE", "UPDATE", "DELETE", "CONNECT", or "*" to match all.

apiGroups lists one or more API groups to match. "" is the core API group. "*" matches all API groups.

apiVersions lists one or more API versions to match. "*" matches all API versions.

resources lists one or more resources to match.

"*" matches all resources, but not subresources.
"*/*" matches all resources and subresources.
"pods/*" matches all subresources of pods.
"*/status" matches all status subresources.
scope specifies a scope to match. Valid values are "Cluster", "Namespaced", and "*". Subresources match the scope of their parent resource. Default is "*".

"Cluster" means that only cluster-scoped resources will match this rule (Namespace API objects are cluster-scoped).
"Namespaced" means that only namespaced resources will match this rule.
"*" means that there are no scope restrictions.
If an incoming request matches one of the specified operations, groups, versions, resources, and scope for any of a webhook's rules, the request is sent to the webhook.

Here are other examples of rules that could be used to specify which resources should be intercepted.

Match CREATE or UPDATE requests to apps/v1 and apps/v1beta1 deployments and replicasets:

apiVersion: admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1
kind: ValidatingWebhookConfiguration
...
webhooks:

- name: my-webhook.example.com
  rules:
  - operations: ["CREATE", "UPDATE"]
    apiGroups: ["apps"]
    apiVersions: ["v1", "v1beta1"]
    resources: ["deployments", "replicasets"]
    scope: "Namespaced"
  ...
Match create requests for all resources (but not subresources) in all API groups and versions:

apiVersion: admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1
kind: ValidatingWebhookConfiguration
webhooks:

- name: my-webhook.example.com
    rules:
  - operations: ["CREATE"]
        apiGroups: ["*"]
        apiVersions: ["*"]
        resources: ["*"]
        scope: "*"
Match update requests for all status subresources in all API groups and versions:

apiVersion: admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1
kind: ValidatingWebhookConfiguration
webhooks:

- name: my-webhook.example.com
    rules:
  - operations: ["UPDATE"]
        apiGroups: ["*"]
        apiVersions: ["*"]
        resources: ["*/status"]
        scope: "*"
Matching requests: objectSelector
Webhooks may optionally limit which requests are intercepted based on the labels of the objects they would be sent, by specifying an objectSelector. If specified, the objectSelector is evaluated against both the object and oldObject that would be sent to the webhook, and is considered to match if either object matches the selector.

A null object (oldObject in the case of create, or newObject in the case of delete), or an object that cannot have labels (like a DeploymentRollback or a PodProxyOptions object) is not considered to match.

Use the object selector only if the webhook is opt-in, because end users may skip the admission webhook by setting the labels.

This example shows a mutating webhook that would match a CREATE of any resource (but not subresources) with the label foo: bar:

apiVersion: admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1
kind: MutatingWebhookConfiguration
webhooks:

- name: my-webhook.example.com
  objectSelector:
    matchLabels:
      foo: bar
  rules:
  - operations: ["CREATE"]
    apiGroups: ["*"]
    apiVersions: ["*"]
    resources: ["*"]
    scope: "*"
See labels concept for more examples of label selectors.

Matching requests: namespaceSelector
Webhooks may optionally limit which requests for namespaced resources are intercepted, based on the labels of the containing namespace, by specifying a namespaceSelector.

The namespaceSelector decides whether to run the webhook on a request for a namespaced resource (or a Namespace object), based on whether the namespace's labels match the selector. If the object itself is a namespace, the matching is performed on object.metadata.labels. If the object is a cluster scoped resource other than a Namespace, namespaceSelector has no effect.

This example shows a mutating webhook that matches a CREATE of any namespaced resource inside a namespace that does not have a "runlevel" label of "0" or "1":

apiVersion: admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1
kind: MutatingWebhookConfiguration
webhooks:

- name: my-webhook.example.com
    namespaceSelector:
      matchExpressions:
        - key: runlevel
          operator: NotIn
          values: ["0","1"]
    rules:
  - operations: ["CREATE"]
        apiGroups: ["*"]
        apiVersions: ["*"]
        resources: ["*"]
        scope: "Namespaced"
This example shows a validating webhook that matches a CREATE of any namespaced resource inside a namespace that is associated with the "environment" of "prod" or "staging":

apiVersion: admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1
kind: ValidatingWebhookConfiguration
webhooks:

- name: my-webhook.example.com
    namespaceSelector:
      matchExpressions:
        - key: environment
          operator: In
          values: ["prod","staging"]
    rules:
  - operations: ["CREATE"]
        apiGroups: ["*"]
        apiVersions: ["*"]
        resources: ["*"]
        scope: "Namespaced"
See labels concept for more examples of label selectors.

Matching requests: matchPolicy
API servers can make objects available via multiple API groups or versions.

For example, if a webhook only specified a rule for some API groups/versions (like apiGroups:["apps"], apiVersions:["v1","v1beta1"]), and a request was made to modify the resource via another API group/version (like extensions/v1beta1), the request would not be sent to the webhook.

The matchPolicy lets a webhook define how its rules are used to match incoming requests. Allowed values are Exact or Equivalent.

Exact means a request should be intercepted only if it exactly matches a specified rule.
Equivalent means a request should be intercepted if it modifies a resource listed in rules, even via another API group or version.
In the example given above, the webhook that only registered for apps/v1 could use matchPolicy:

matchPolicy: Exact would mean the extensions/v1beta1 request would not be sent to the webhook
matchPolicy: Equivalent means the extensions/v1beta1 request would be sent to the webhook (with the objects converted to a version the webhook had specified: apps/v1)
Specifying Equivalent is recommended, and ensures that webhooks continue to intercept the resources they expect when upgrades enable new versions of the resource in the API server.

When a resource stops being served by the API server, it is no longer considered equivalent to other versions of that resource that are still served. For example, extensions/v1beta1 deployments were first deprecated and then removed (in Kubernetes v1.16).

Since that removal, a webhook with a apiGroups:["extensions"], apiVersions:["v1beta1"], resources:["deployments"] rule does not intercept deployments created via apps/v1 APIs. For that reason, webhooks should prefer registering for stable versions of resources.

This example shows a validating webhook that intercepts modifications to deployments (no matter the API group or version), and is always sent an apps/v1 Deployment object:

apiVersion: admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1
kind: ValidatingWebhookConfiguration
webhooks:

- name: my-webhook.example.com
  matchPolicy: Equivalent
  rules:
  - operations: ["CREATE","UPDATE","DELETE"]
    apiGroups: ["apps"]
    apiVersions: ["v1"]
    resources: ["deployments"]
    scope: "Namespaced"
The matchPolicy for an admission webhooks defaults to Equivalent.

Matching requests: matchConditions
FEATURE STATE: Kubernetes v1.30 [stable] (enabled by default: true)
You can define match conditions for webhooks if you need fine-grained request filtering. These conditions are useful if you find that match rules, objectSelectors and namespaceSelectors still doesn't provide the filtering you want over when to call out over HTTP. Match conditions are CEL expressions. All match conditions must evaluate to true for the webhook to be called.

Here is an example illustrating a few different uses for match conditions:

apiVersion: admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1
kind: ValidatingWebhookConfiguration
webhooks:

- name: my-webhook.example.com
    matchPolicy: Equivalent
    rules:
  - operations: ['CREATE','UPDATE']
        apiGroups: ['*']
        apiVersions: ['*']
        resources: ['*']
    failurePolicy: 'Ignore' # Fail-open (optional)
    sideEffects: None
    clientConfig:
      service:
        namespace: my-namespace
        name: my-webhook
      caBundle: '<omitted>'

    # You can have up to 64 matchConditions per webhook

    matchConditions:
  - name: 'exclude-leases' # Each match condition must have a unique name
        expression: '!(request.resource.group == "coordination.k8s.io" && request.resource.resource == "leases")' # Match non-lease resources.
  - name: 'exclude-kubelet-requests'
        expression: '!("system:nodes" in request.userInfo.groups)' # Match requests made by non-node users.
  - name: 'rbac' # Skip RBAC requests, which are handled by the second webhook.
        expression: 'request.resource.group != "rbac.authorization.k8s.io"'
  
# This example illustrates the use of the 'authorizer'. The authorization check is more expensive

# than a simple expression, so in this example it is scoped to only RBAC requests by using a second

# webhook. Both webhooks can be served by the same endpoint

- name: rbac.my-webhook.example.com
    matchPolicy: Equivalent
    rules:
  - operations: ['CREATE','UPDATE']
        apiGroups: ['rbac.authorization.k8s.io']
        apiVersions: ['*']
        resources: ['*']
    failurePolicy: 'Fail' # Fail-closed (the default)
    sideEffects: None
    clientConfig:
      service:
        namespace: my-namespace
        name: my-webhook
      caBundle: '<omitted>'

    # You can have up to 64 matchConditions per webhook

    matchConditions:
  - name: 'breakglass'

        # Skip requests made by users authorized to 'breakglass' on this webhook

        # The 'breakglass' API verb does not need to exist outside this check

        expression: '!authorizer.group("admissionregistration.k8s.io").resource("validatingwebhookconfigurations").name("my-webhook.example.com").check("breakglass").allowed()'

Note:
You can define up to 64 elements in the matchConditions field per webhook.
Match conditions have access to the following CEL variables:

object - The object from the incoming request. The value is null for DELETE requests. The object version may be converted based on the matchPolicy.
oldObject - The existing object. The value is null for CREATE requests.
request - The request portion of the AdmissionReview, excluding object and oldObject.
authorizer - A CEL Authorizer. May be used to perform authorization checks for the principal (authenticated user) of the request. See Authz in the Kubernetes CEL library documentation for more details.
authorizer.requestResource - A shortcut for an authorization check configured with the request resource (group, resource, (subresource), namespace, name).
For more information on CEL expressions, refer to the Common Expression Language in Kubernetes reference.

In the event of an error evaluating a match condition the webhook is never called. Whether to reject the request is determined as follows:

If any match condition evaluated to false (regardless of other errors), the API server skips the webhook.
Otherwise:
for failurePolicy: Fail, reject the request (without calling the webhook).
for failurePolicy: Ignore, proceed with the request but skip the webhook.
Contacting the webhook
Once the API server has determined a request should be sent to a webhook, it needs to know how to contact the webhook. This is specified in the clientConfig stanza of the webhook configuration.

Webhooks can either be called via a URL or a service reference, and can optionally include a custom CA bundle to use to verify the TLS connection.

URL
url gives the location of the webhook, in standard URL form (scheme://host:port/path).

The host should not refer to a service running in the cluster; use a service reference by specifying the service field instead. The host might be resolved via external DNS in some API servers (e.g., kube-apiserver cannot resolve in-cluster DNS as that would be a layering violation). host may also be an IP address.

Please note that using localhost or 127.0.0.1 as a host is risky unless you take great care to run this webhook on all hosts which run an API server which might need to make calls to this webhook. Such installations are likely to be non-portable or not readily run in a new cluster.

The scheme must be "https"; the URL must begin with "https://".

Attempting to use a user or basic auth (for example user:password@) is not allowed. Fragments (#...) and query parameters (?...) are also not allowed.

Here is an example of a mutating webhook configured to call a URL (and expects the TLS certificate to be verified using system trust roots, so does not specify a caBundle):

apiVersion: admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1
kind: MutatingWebhookConfiguration
webhooks:

- name: my-webhook.example.com
  clientConfig:
    url: "<https://my-webhook.example.com:9443/my-webhook-path>"
Service reference
The service stanza inside clientConfig is a reference to the service for this webhook. If the webhook is running within the cluster, then you should use service instead of url. The service namespace and name are required. The port is optional and defaults to 443. The path is optional and defaults to "/".

Here is an example of a mutating webhook configured to call a service on port "1234" at the subpath "/my-path", and to verify the TLS connection against the ServerName my-service-name.my-service-namespace.svc using a custom CA bundle:

apiVersion: admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1
kind: MutatingWebhookConfiguration
webhooks:

- name: my-webhook.example.com
  clientConfig:
    caBundle: <CA_BUNDLE>
    service:
      namespace: my-service-namespace
      name: my-service-name
      path: /my-path
      port: 1234
Note:
You must replace the <CA_BUNDLE> in the above example by a valid CA bundle which is a PEM-encoded CA bundle for validating the webhook's server certificate.
Side effects
Webhooks typically operate only on the content of the AdmissionReview sent to them. Some webhooks, however, make out-of-band changes as part of processing admission requests.

Webhooks that make out-of-band changes ("side effects") must also have a reconciliation mechanism (like a controller) that periodically determines the actual state of the world, and adjusts the out-of-band data modified by the admission webhook to reflect reality. This is because a call to an admission webhook does not guarantee the admitted object will be persisted as is, or at all. Later webhooks can modify the content of the object, a conflict could be encountered while writing to storage, or the server could power off before persisting the object.

Additionally, webhooks with side effects must skip those side-effects when dryRun: true admission requests are handled. A webhook must explicitly indicate that it will not have side-effects when run with dryRun, or the dry-run request will not be sent to the webhook and the API request will fail instead.

Webhooks indicate whether they have side effects using the sideEffects field in the webhook configuration:

None: calling the webhook will have no side effects.
NoneOnDryRun: calling the webhook will possibly have side effects, but if a request with dryRun: true is sent to the webhook, the webhook will suppress the side effects (the webhook is dryRun-aware).
Here is an example of a validating webhook indicating it has no side effects on dryRun: true requests:

apiVersion: admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1
kind: ValidatingWebhookConfiguration
webhooks:

- name: my-webhook.example.com
    sideEffects: NoneOnDryRun
Timeouts
Because webhooks add to API request latency, they should evaluate as quickly as possible. timeoutSeconds allows configuring how long the API server should wait for a webhook to respond before treating the call as a failure.

If the timeout expires before the webhook responds, the webhook call will be ignored or the API call will be rejected based on the failure policy.

The timeout value must be between 1 and 30 seconds.

Here is an example of a validating webhook with a custom timeout of 2 seconds:

apiVersion: admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1
kind: ValidatingWebhookConfiguration
webhooks:

- name: my-webhook.example.com
    timeoutSeconds: 2
The timeout for an admission webhook defaults to 10 seconds.

Reinvocation policy
A single ordering of mutating admissions plugins (including webhooks) does not work for all cases (see <https://issue.k8s.io/64333> as an example). A mutating webhook can add a new sub-structure to the object (like adding a container to a pod), and other mutating plugins which have already run may have opinions on those new structures (like setting an imagePullPolicy on all containers).

To allow mutating admission plugins to observe changes made by other plugins, built-in mutating admission plugins are re-run if a mutating webhook modifies an object, and mutating webhooks can specify a reinvocationPolicy to control whether they are reinvoked as well.

reinvocationPolicy may be set to Never or IfNeeded. It defaults to Never.

Never: the webhook must not be called more than once in a single admission evaluation.
IfNeeded: the webhook may be called again as part of the admission evaluation if the object being admitted is modified by other admission plugins after the initial webhook call.
The important elements to note are:

The number of additional invocations is not guaranteed to be exactly one.
If additional invocations result in further modifications to the object, webhooks are not guaranteed to be invoked again.
Webhooks that use this option may be reordered to minimize the number of additional invocations.
To validate an object after all mutations are guaranteed complete, use a validating admission webhook instead (recommended for webhooks with side-effects).
Here is an example of a mutating webhook opting into being re-invoked if later admission plugins modify the object:

apiVersion: admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1
kind: MutatingWebhookConfiguration
webhooks:

- name: my-webhook.example.com
  reinvocationPolicy: IfNeeded
Mutating webhooks must be idempotent, able to successfully process an object they have already admitted and potentially modified. This is true for all mutating admission webhooks, since any change they can make in an object could already exist in the user-provided object, but it is essential for webhooks that opt into reinvocation.

Failure policy
failurePolicy defines how unrecognized errors and timeout errors from the admission webhook are handled. Allowed values are Ignore or Fail.

Ignore means that an error calling the webhook is ignored and the API request is allowed to continue.
Fail means that an error calling the webhook causes the admission to fail and the API request to be rejected.
Here is a mutating webhook configured to reject an API request if errors are encountered calling the admission webhook:

apiVersion: admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1
kind: MutatingWebhookConfiguration
webhooks:

- name: my-webhook.example.com
  failurePolicy: Fail
The default failurePolicy for an admission webhooks is Fail.

Monitoring admission webhooks
The API server provides ways to monitor admission webhook behaviors. These monitoring mechanisms help cluster admins to answer questions like:

Which mutating webhook mutated the object in a API request?

What change did the mutating webhook applied to the object?

Which webhooks are frequently rejecting API requests? What's the reason for a rejection?

Mutating webhook auditing annotations
Sometimes it's useful to know which mutating webhook mutated the object in a API request, and what change did the webhook apply.

The Kubernetes API server performs auditing on each mutating webhook invocation. Each invocation generates an auditing annotation capturing if a request object is mutated by the invocation, and optionally generates an annotation capturing the applied patch from the webhook admission response. The annotations are set in the audit event for given request on given stage of its execution, which is then pre-processed according to a certain policy and written to a backend.

The audit level of a event determines which annotations get recorded:

At Metadata audit level or higher, an annotation with key mutation.webhook.admission.k8s.io/round_{round idx}*index*{order idx} gets logged with JSON payload indicating a webhook gets invoked for given request and whether it mutated the object or not.

For example, the following annotation gets recorded for a webhook being reinvoked. The webhook is ordered the third in the mutating webhook chain, and didn't mutated the request object during the invocation.

# the audit event recorded

{
    "kind": "Event",
    "apiVersion": "audit.k8s.io/v1",
    "annotations": {
        "mutation.webhook.admission.k8s.io/round_1_index_2": "{\"configuration\":\"my-mutating-webhook-configuration.example.com\",\"webhook\":\"my-webhook.example.com\",\"mutated\": false}"
        # other annotations
        ...
    }
    # other fields
    ...
}

# the annotation value deserialized

{
    "configuration": "my-mutating-webhook-configuration.example.com",
    "webhook": "my-webhook.example.com",
    "mutated": false
}
The following annotation gets recorded for a webhook being invoked in the first round. The webhook is ordered the first in the mutating webhook chain, and mutated the request object during the invocation.

# the audit event recorded

{
    "kind": "Event",
    "apiVersion": "audit.k8s.io/v1",
    "annotations": {
        "mutation.webhook.admission.k8s.io/round_0_index_0": "{\"configuration\":\"my-mutating-webhook-configuration.example.com\",\"webhook\":\"my-webhook-always-mutate.example.com\",\"mutated\": true}"
        # other annotations
        ...
    }
    # other fields
    ...
}

# the annotation value deserialized

{
    "configuration": "my-mutating-webhook-configuration.example.com",
    "webhook": "my-webhook-always-mutate.example.com",
    "mutated": true
}
At Request audit level or higher, an annotation with key patch.webhook.admission.k8s.io/round_{round idx}*index*{order idx} gets logged with JSON payload indicating a webhook gets invoked for given request and what patch gets applied to the request object.

For example, the following annotation gets recorded for a webhook being reinvoked. The webhook is ordered the fourth in the mutating webhook chain, and responded with a JSON patch which got applied to the request object.

# the audit event recorded

{
    "kind": "Event",
    "apiVersion": "audit.k8s.io/v1",
    "annotations": {
        "patch.webhook.admission.k8s.io/round_1_index_3": "{\"configuration\":\"my-other-mutating-webhook-configuration.example.com\",\"webhook\":\"my-webhook-always-mutate.example.com\",\"patch\":[{\"op\":\"add\",\"path\":\"/data/mutation-stage\",\"value\":\"yes\"}],\"patchType\":\"JSONPatch\"}"
        # other annotations
        ...
    }
    # other fields
    ...
}

# the annotation value deserialized

{
    "configuration": "my-other-mutating-webhook-configuration.example.com",
    "webhook": "my-webhook-always-mutate.example.com",
    "patchType": "JSONPatch",
    "patch": [
        {
            "op": "add",
            "path": "/data/mutation-stage",
            "value": "yes"
        }
    ]
}
Admission webhook metrics
The API server exposes Prometheus metrics from the /metrics endpoint, which can be used for monitoring and diagnosing API server status. The following metrics record status related to admission webhooks.

API server admission webhook rejection count
Sometimes it's useful to know which admission webhooks are frequently rejecting API requests, and the reason for a rejection.

The API server exposes a Prometheus counter metric recording admission webhook rejections. The metrics are labelled to identify the causes of webhook rejection(s):

name: the name of the webhook that rejected a request.

operation: the operation type of the request, can be one of CREATE, UPDATE, DELETE and CONNECT.

type: the admission webhook type, can be one of admit and validating.

error_type: identifies if an error occurred during the webhook invocation that caused the rejection. Its value can be one of:

calling_webhook_error: unrecognized errors or timeout errors from the admission webhook happened and the webhook's Failure policy is set to Fail.
no_error: no error occurred. The webhook rejected the request with allowed: false in the admission response. The metrics label rejection_code records the .status.code set in the admission response.
apiserver_internal_error: an API server internal error happened.
rejection_code: the HTTP status code set in the admission response when a webhook rejected a request.

Example of the rejection count metrics:

# HELP apiserver_admission_webhook_rejection_count [ALPHA] Admission webhook rejection count, identified by name and broken out for each admission type (validating or admit) and operation. Additional labels specify an error type (calling_webhook_error or apiserver_internal_error if an error occurred; no_error otherwise) and optionally a non-zero rejection code if the webhook rejects the request with an HTTP status code (honored by the apiserver when the code is greater or equal to 400). Codes greater than 600 are truncated to 600, to keep the metrics cardinality bounded

# TYPE apiserver_admission_webhook_rejection_count counter

apiserver_admission_webhook_rejection_count{error_type="calling_webhook_error",name="always-timeout-webhook.example.com",operation="CREATE",rejection_code="0",type="validating"} 1
apiserver_admission_webhook_rejection_count{error_type="calling_webhook_error",name="invalid-admission-response-webhook.example.com",operation="CREATE",rejection_code="0",type="validating"} 1
apiserver_admission_webhook_rejection_count{error_type="no_error",name="deny-unwanted-configmap-data.example.com",operation="CREATE",rejection_code="400",type="validating"} 13
